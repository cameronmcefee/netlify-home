title: Automation
description: "Let netlify automise your workflow. The seperation of frontend and backend opens up a whole new world of possibilities. But it also means a lot of manual work, manually integrating and managing different tools and processes. Until now."
features:
  - title: Git Integration
    body: "Netlify naturally pairs with Git. If you use GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket or just your own Private repo, we mirror that pull, change, push workflow into your site’s state."
  - title: Automated Builds
    body: Leave the build boxes to us. Continuous deployment is as simple as just telling us how and what to build. Then with standard git commands you can rapidly deploy your site.
  - title: Inbound Webhooks
    body: "Duis sapien ante, hendrerit eget scelerisque id, consectetur eu tortor. Maecenas vulputate et odio ut varius. Duis vitae elit mauris."
  - title: "Outbound Webhooks & Integrations"
    body: "Nunc in purus sem. In tempus, massa sit amet imperdiet vehicula, nunc metus sodales sapien, non lacinia arcu ex non dolor."
  - title: Secure Build Environment
    body: "Vivamus eu dapibus libero, ut gravida odio. Vestibulum lacinia eu lacus eu efficitur. Praesent ac quam risus. Nullam et feugiat tortor."
  - title: Cached Dependencies
    body: Vivamus sed sodales urna. Donec commodo massa quis massa commodo condimentum. Phasellus auctor ultricies aliquet.
  - title: Instant Cache Invalidation
    body: "One of the troubles with releasing a new site is that you never know if a user has a cached version. Netlify invalidates the cache instantly, only serving the intended version across the globe. Never wait to see a live version again."
  - title: "Versioning & Rollbacks"
    body: Each lightweight deploy is treated as an immutable snapshot of the site. Rolling back as far as you’d like is just a matter of clicking the right version you want.
