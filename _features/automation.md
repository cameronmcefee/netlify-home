title: Automation
description: "Let netlify automise your workflow. The seperation of frontend and backend opens up a whole new world of possibilities. But it also means a lot of manual work, manually integrating and managing different tools and processes. Until now."
features:
  - title: Git Integration
    body: "Netlify naturally pairs with Git. If you use GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket or just your own Private repo, we mirror that pull, change, push workflow into your site’s state."
  - title: Automated Builds
    body: Leave the build boxes to us. Continuous deployment is as simple as just telling us how and what to build. Then with standard git commands you can rapidly deploy your site.
  - title: Inbound Webhooks
    body: "Trigger builds with a POST request. [What can you do with webhooks?](https://www.netlify.com/docs/webhooks)"
  - title: "Outbound Webhooks & Integrations"
    body: "Set up any number of outbound webhooks. Receive Slack notifications for new form submissions, deploys or build failures. — [What can you do with webhooks?](https://www.netlify.com/docs/webhooks)"
  - title: Secure Build Environment
    body: "We never store any GitHub tokens on our servers and your builds are run in a completely locked down environment. — [Read more about GitHub tokens &amp; netlify](https://www.netlify.com/docs/github-permissions)"
  - title: Cached Dependencies
    body: "Dependencies (rubygems, npm, etc.) are automatically installed and cached between builds to keep build time down. — [Read more about dependencies and run times](https://www.netlify.com/docs/continuous-deployment)"
  - title: Instant Cache Invalidation
    body: "One of the troubles with releasing a new site is that you never know if a user has a cached version. Netlify invalidates the cache instantly, only serving the intended version across the globe. Never wait to see a live version again."
  - title: "Versioning & Rollbacks"
    body: Each lightweight deploy is treated as an immutable snapshot of the site. Rolling back as far as you’d like is just a matter of clicking the right version you want.
