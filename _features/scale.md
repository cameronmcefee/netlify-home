features:
  - title: Infinite Scale
    body: "Seamlessly grow from a personal blog to an international phenomenon. Our global CDN ensures your site is always fast like greased lightning, regardless of load."
  - title: Complex Site Support
    body: "Using intelligent caching, updating your site is painless. Automatically uploading only the parts that change each time minimizes, minimizing the time spent waiting for 1000s of pages to upload."
  - title: Automated Hosting
    body: "Our developer tools make it easy to create, deploy, and automatically manage thousands of unique sites. Our philosophy is the more sites, the merrier."
  - title: Asset Fingerprinting
    body: "By fingerprinting assets, we ensure that the version of the site is globally consistent. Gone are the days of wondering what site people see."
  - title: Geo IP/Language Redirection
    body:  "Our global CDN supports complex internationalization rules. One DNS lookup will always yield site in the right language."
  - title: Gradual Migration
    body: "We get it – moving is scary. Using the redirect rules, incrementally migrating to netlify is safe and simple. [See how to “Go Static Without Losing Your Server”](/blog/2016/03/09/go-static-without-losing-your-server.html)"
  - title: Atomic Deploys
    body: "We view your site as a whole, not a bunch of pages. Deploying a new version is trivial and so is rolling back. Ya know in case you typo something."
  - title: Unlimited Snapshots
    body: "We keep snapshots of any version of your site so you can track changes and revert back to any point in time with the click of a button."
