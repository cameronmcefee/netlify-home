title: Scale
description: "Netlify scales with your site. Whether it's a personal blog made with no-framework or a huge multilingual site with 20,000 pages, 10s of adminstrators, and a whole array of buildtools and frameworks connecting to all kinds of APIs, netlify is your platform of choice. And best of all? You always only pay for what you use. No need to overprovision for hosting."
features:
  - title: Infinite Scale
    body: "Seamlessly grow from a personal blog to an international phenomenon. Our global CDN ensures your site is always fast like greased lightning, regardless of load."
  - title: Complex Site Support
    body: "Using intelligent caching, updating your site is painless. Automatically uploading only the parts that change each time minimizes, minimizing the time spent waiting for 1000s of pages to upload."
  - title: Automated Hosting
    body: "Our developer tools make it easy to create, deploy, and automatically manage thousands of unique sites. Our philosophy is the more sites, the merrier."
  - title: Asset Fingerprinting
    body: "By fingerprinting assets, we ensure that the version of the site is globally consistent. Gone are the days of wondering what site people see."
  - title: Geo IP/Language Redirection
    body: "Our global CDN supports complex internationalization rules. One DNS lookup will always yield site in the right language. What it means? That if you need visitors from let's say China to redirect to your Chinese version of the site, then netlify can do that for you at CDN level so you loose none of the performance you would normally do."
  - title: Gradual Migration
    body: "We get it – moving is scary. Using the redirect rules, incrementally migrating to netlify is safe and simple. [See how to “Go Static Without Losing Your Server”](/blog/2016/03/09/go-static-without-losing-your-server.html)"
  - title: Atomic Deploys
    body: "We view your site as a whole, not a bunch of pages. Deploying a new version is trivial and so is rolling back. Ya know in case you typo something."
  - title: Unlimited Snapshots
    body: We keep snapshots of any version of your site so you can track changes and revert back to any point in time with the click of a button.
