<Sculpin TUTORIAL STUFF?>


### Pushing Sculpin to GitHub
<a id="githubstart"></a>

We want to set up an online GitHub repository with our local environment and push our local files to this repository. Next, we'll connect netlify to the repository for our automatic build (i.e. whenever you push to GitHub, netlify will rebuild your site).

#### 1. Create your Git Repo
We start by creating a [GitHub](https://github.com/) repository for our Sculpin site and generator.

We're naming ours sculpin-demo and we'll skip adding files to the repository until after its creation, as this can sometimes create problems (The README, license and gitignore files).

Once the repository has been named and created we'll return to local environment.

#### 2. Prepare the Site for GitHub
We need to set the local site up as a git repository with the `git init` command, then we'll add all the files and subdirectories to the repository with the `git add .` command and finally stage them for the first commit with the `git commit -m 'First commit'` command.

In quick succession in a terminal window:

```
cd my-sculpin-site
git init
git add .
git commit -m 'First commit'
```

Once the files are committed, it's time to connect with the GitHub repository online.

#### 3. Get & Add Remote URL
![a1_remotegithuburl.png](/uploads/a1_remotegithuburl.png)

We return to the GitHub repository created earlier and retrieve the URL for the remote repository, since this is where our local repository will be pushed.
Either copy paste the whole command or use the button as depicted above, to copy just the path to your clipboard.
Return to the Terminal window and paste the remote repository URL inside the following line (instead of My-Repository-URL):

```
git remote add origin My-Repository-URL
```

Optional: To check that it's set up correctly, you can use the following command:

```
git remote -v
```

If it looks all right, we're ready to push the files.

#### 4. Push to GitHub.
The final task before we're done setting up, is to use the push command with git, as in the following line in Terminal:

```
git push -u origin master
```

All your files will be copied to your online repository. Once it's done, take a look at the repository online to check if everything looks correct.

It's time to connect it with netlify.

### Connect with netlify
<a id="netlifystart"></a>

Creating a new site on netlify is intuitive and once you’ve created an account and logged in, you’ll be taken to https://app.netlify.com/sites.

#### Step 1: Add Your New Site
![Netlify New Site](/uploads/newsitebut.png)
Click the *"New Site"* button (as seen above) to get started.

#### Step 2: Link to Your GitHub
Clicking *“New Site”* brings you to this screen:
![Link to GitHub](/uploads/createsite.png)
When you push to GitHub, netlify does all the work. No more wasting time on manual deploying of updates or changes!

Since we're hosting the site assets on GitHub, we’ll need to link netlify with GitHub. Click the button *“Link to GitHub”*.

#### Step 3: Authorize netlify
You can skip this step, if you already have an account with netlify set up to automatically login!

You will be asked to provide your GitHub login details:
![GitHub Login](/uploads/githublogin.png)

We need to let netlify and GitHub talk to each other, so review the permissions and then click authorize application.
![Authorize netlify](/uploads/authorization.png)

Like it says in the image above on the right, netlify doesn’t store your GitHub access token on our servers! 

If you’d like to know more about the permissions netlify requests and why we need them, you can check out our [documentation on GitHub Permissions](https://docs.GitHubNetlify.com/github-permissions/). 

#### Step 4: Choose Your Repo
<PICTURE - ADD choose repo sculpin-demo PIC>
Once you're connected to GitHub, netlify will show you a list of your GitHub repositories, as seen above.
For the purpose of this tutorial we'll select the *“sculpin-demo”* repo we just pushed to GitHub. 

#### Step 5: Configure Your Settings
Fill in the configuration settings as seen in the screen shot below:
<PICTURE - ADD sculpin settings PIC>

Click the *'Save'* button and watch the magic unfold.

#### Step 6: Build Your Site
<PICTURE - ADD site building PIC>
Once you click save, netlify will step in and take over, though it will let you know what's happening along the way. This may take a few minutes, so take a break and netlify will do the rest, while you watch the progress.

#### Step 7: The End
That's it.

Once netlify has build your site, it will assign a random name to it and you'll be presented with the site and the control panel for the site, ready for additional cusomizing.

You can change the site to be private and password protected, which is great for work in progress. You can also assign a custom domain name and it's easy to change settings for your site in general and gives you a good quick overview.
