### Welcome to Netlify
<NANOC INTRO>


<LINKS>
If you already have a Nanoc repository forked on GitHub and only wish to connect to Netlify, you can skip the bulk of this guide and start [here](#netlifystart) instead.

On the other hand, if you have Nanoc running locally, but need some guidance getting it on GitHub, before you deploy to Netlify, start [here](#githubstart) instead.

Finally, if you're completely new to Nanoc, simply continue this guide onwards and downwards.  

***Please note that this guide assumes you have Ruby and Bundler installed !!!***

For information about installing and handling Ruby with Bundler please see [this guide](http://bundler.io/).
