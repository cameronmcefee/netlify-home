### **Welcome to Netlify**
<2003: 13 years ago just before PHP version 5.0 (July 2004) and so not so different from today it has evolved a lot, Javascript version 1.5 with netscape navigator 6.0, mozilla firefox 1.0 and IE 5.5 to 9, Opera 7.0, safari 3.0-5 and chrome 1.0-10.066, HTML 4.0 version from 99-01 I used out dated tags now have new ones, most popular browsers in 2003 was basically Internet Explorer the lot of them, dominating with a market share of over 90% contrasted with today where completely new players have not only emerged, but taken over the majority of the market, with IE accounting for now only 10-25% and Chrome and Android have taken over with a market dominating 42%-52.67% and one shouldn't forget Firefox at just under 10% or Safari at 12.39% to 19.8%.  WordPress? WordPress was used by more than 23.3% of the top 10 million websites as of January 2015, but when I left it had only just been born (May 2003) and so while I've heard both good and bad about it, I've never actually used it myself. I am aware of its security issues and heavily bloated code, but also its enticing use of themes that are apart from the site structure and it's so used and well supported.
DreamWeaver used it back when it was Macromedia Dreamweaver MX 6.0 (May 2002) and today I'm not even on a Windows machine and true, that might also have helped me make the more educated decision when today I'm on Linux? COMPARED to 2016 versions today>



I only recently began my foray into the realm of the static site generators, as I learned about Netlify and a new and smarter way of making homepages and yes, I'm referring to the use of the static site generator. I hadn't made a homepage for something like 13 years and while the world had progressed enormously when it comes to technology, I found myself in a place that is lacking behind technologically and only recently began getting more connected.
I started with a homepage written by hand using HTML, javascript, CSS and PHP and heavy load of google searching and I found that a lot had changed. In fact it seemed like all the HTML had changed completely and the PHP and javascript, well to be honest I didn't remember too much about either, but 13 years ago, PHP version 5.0 still hadn't even been released. 

OK, so while my memory has been steadily declining since then, I did remember other things from back in the day - e.g. that Internet Explorer was king, sitting on more than 90% of the market. Contrast that with today where completely new players have taken over and the market has split up with several well known browser brands sitting each on a decent market share. The new King is easy to identify as Google with Chrome and Android accounting for an estimated 42%-52.67% of the browsing. I've heard a lot about WordPress over the years and I did contemplate if this was the way to go for me. An estimated 23.3% of the top 10 million websites as of January 2015 can't be wrong and it's the most popular blogging platform for a reason, but it's also bloated and slow and insecure and from what little I had seen, I found it messy.

I wasted an aeon of time writing that first homepage in 13 years and relearning a bit of both javascript, PHP, HTML and CSS and this knowledge has actually been quite useful when looking through the various static site generators, but more than that, these site generators have come a long way to say the least and this is where I found something interesting. I used some boot strap code and free libraries and made a half decent old school homepage and nothing fancy. However, I learned that I do not want to go back to the primitive way of constructing a homepage I used long ago and I do not want to  waste my time getting into WordPress or a similar dynamic and outdated approach. Granted - Matt, Chris and Aaron at netlify had been spamming my email with articles about these magical machines that could, to a certain degree, spit out a static homepage given various parameters, but it wasn't until I saw it with my own eyes that I started believing and understanding that this was and is the future. Not one of the arguments against a change to static site generators hold any real substence in 2016. They have all been dismantled or been invalidated with new technology. Let me give you some examples.

Dynamic content - probably the biggest issue with static site generators today is their inability to handle dynamic web pages that require lots of user feedback or content that is build on demand. E.g. from information about the visitor. Another issue here is if you need to rebuild the page often, as that would surely negate some of the pros of a static site generated page, such as the website speed. However there are today 3rd party plugins to help with these or outright solve them and quite a few of the site generators are offering good dynamic functionality these days. 

CMS system - not everyone will find it easier to build using a static site generator over a CMS based system, such as WordPress and especially one that is as mature as WordPress. This is also an argument against static site generators as they do not have a CMS system, though various solutions have been made and in recent times actual CMS systems capable of running with your static site generator of choice (like Netlify CMS) have seen the light and are paving the way for even more people to make the jump to the future.

The biggest cons are probably the need to implement 3rd party services for things like dynamic content, or comments. Beyond that, it’s very hard to see why you shouldn’t be using a static website. Is the admin dashboard really all that important, when you could focus much more on the content instead?

Since you've read this article this far, chances favor that you know about [TTFB](#TTFB), [SEO](#SEO), [Latency](#latency) and [Bouncerate](#Bouncerate) plus many other terms and acronyms for various technical ways of talking about web sites, their speed, search engine placement and general usefulness. If you don't, please do not despair, as I will try to explain each in a bit more detail in this articles mini [dictionary](#dictionary) and how and why they're important to us and probably should be to you as well, if you make or perhaps even just use web pages (and who's not online in 2016?).

The main problem as I see it, as someone who tried making web pages back in the early 2000 and before, is that the web has changed and has an even greater potential for change, but the vast majority of people making web pages have not and neither have their methods (at least to some degree) and so when I came back to this world 13 years later, I was surprised to see that in many cases, the methods for creating these had become less efficient, even if for the web page programmers it meant the page was easier or faster to create. 

E.g. instead of coding a page from the ground up by hand, I found that most of my old colleagues were using highly in-efficient web page creation tools that made their jobs much easier, but their web pages bloated, insecure and inefficient.  Sure, the internet has gotten ridicilously fast since then, as everything and everyone becomes more connected, but we shouldn't simply rely on technology, to compensate for laziness and lack of efficiency.  

When I left Europe, I had a .5Mbit ADSL and now, sitting in a country where most people lack electricity and running water, I've got a rather cheap and stable 8Mbit fiber optics connection! Either way, both are more than adequate in speed and stability for just about any web page out there, but that still doesn't mean I have the patience to wait for larger loads or am not concerned about good SEO and bouncerate on the projects I work on.  Security in particular has become important as all things do when they become the eye of too much focus and attention, with all that's been happening since then (like the government spying on us, everything seems to be leaking and what have you not).




### Mini Dictionary
<a id="#dictionary"></a>
I've put the various terms here, with a small definition for each.

#### SEO or Search Engine Optimization
<a id="SEO"></a>
OK, so where to start.  I think it's important to quickly mention SEO which is the acronym for Search Engine Optimization and extremely important, if you want to spread your message. The better your web page fits in with the current SEO rules, as defined mostly by Google (simply because they've got the most used search engine) the higher it will rank on search engines and the higher it ranks, the more visitors you'll get - simple enough.

These rules started out as a few and far in between and have come to encompass rather a lot more and today, while by far not the most important factor in good SEO, speed has nevertheless become a factor. Basically put, the faster your page loads, the higher it will potentially rank, which does make some sense from a users perspective. Still though, content is the more important factor in the overall ranking.

#### TTFB or Time-To-First-Byte
<a id="TTFB"></a>
What is TTFB or Time-To-First-Byte and does it correlate with SEO and the speed with which a page loads?
Well, let's start by quickly defining TTFB as per the manual - it's a metric affected by three components as follows:
1. The time it takes for your request to propagate through the network to the web server
2. The time it takes for the web server to process the request and generate the response
3. The time it takes for the response to propagate back through the network to your browser.
So basically put, it's the time it takes for the first bit to get back through the network to your browser, after you've requested a given page to be shown. With todays search engines the answer is a resounding yes - Time-To-First-Byte, while not the most important factor, is nevertheless a factor when computing your overall score and thus should be kept as low as reasonably possible..

#### Page Loading Speed
Not the same as TTFB, though it's pretty close. This however, is the time it takes before the end user has the whole page downloaded, working and visual before their eyes.

#### Latency, Distance & Bandwith
<a id="latency"></a>
Distance and bandwith - the distance to the server that all data has to travel, but the wider the bandwith the more data can travel simoultaneously. 
<PICTURE of water in pipe or data in stream to illustrate perhaps?>

Latency is defined as the amount of time it takes to transmit a single piece of data from one location to another. How far things are from each other is a fairly constant factor or is it? When you start using CDN's (Content Delivery Network's) the closest CDN server will send you the copy of the site bit by bit and this helps negate the problem otherwise seen with distance, so it stands to good reason that you'd expect a CDN to be built in to any modern solution big or small and obviously this is now possible with hosts like Netlify, even for a free accounts.

#### Bouncerate
<a id="Bouncerate"></a>
The bouncerate of a site is defined as the visitors who enter and then leave or bounce from a site, rather than stay on to view other pages within the same site. Hence the term bounce is coined from the reference to how many visitors bounce from the site and this number would be referred to as the bouncerate and obviously you would want to keep it as low as possible.
