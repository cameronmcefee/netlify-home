Post processing settings

  
Now netlify gives you detailed control over the post processing we do to your sites.

  
You can completely disable post processing for sites where you mainly want to share HTML/CSS and don&rsquo;t care about performance, pretty URLs, form processing or snippet injection.

  
Apart from that you can control Pretty URLs, bundling and minification of CSS and JavaScript and lossless image compressions.
