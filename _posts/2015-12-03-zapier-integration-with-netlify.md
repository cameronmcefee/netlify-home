As you may have seen in yesterday's newsletter netlify now have a Zapier app in beta.

It lets you integrate form submissions or deploy notifications from netlify to hundreds of external services like MailChimp, Hipchat, Google Docs, etc,.

What that means is that in a few easy steps you can set up the app to send you a notification whenever a new form is submitted, or a deploy is finished and pushed live. The notification could be a mail, a message in slack or hipchat, or almost anywhere else.

But don't take our word for it. 
Matt Hackington, a long time BitBalloon and netlify customer, runs several popular codeschools in the Bay Area (with a last name like that you almost have to right?). 
He has made a great video tutorial showing you exactly how to set it up, and agreed for us to let us show it on our blog.

A free monitoring service for your developer toolbelt. Enjoy.
